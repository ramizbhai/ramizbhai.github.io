# Images Directory

This directory contains project images and certificates.

## Image Requirements

For optimal performance, images should be:
- **Format**: WebP (with fallback to JPG/PNG)
- **Optimized**: Compressed and resized appropriately
- **Lazy Loaded**: Images will be lazy loaded automatically

## Directory Structure

- `projects/` - Project screenshots and thumbnails
- `certificates/` - Certificate images

## Adding Images

1. Add project images to `projects/` directory
2. Add certificate images to `certificates/` directory
3. Update image paths in JSON files if needed
